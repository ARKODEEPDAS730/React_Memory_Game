Eidetic007: Visuospatial Memory & Interference Game
Eidetic007 (pronounced Eye-det-ick) is a specialized cognitive training application built with React.js. Named after "eidetic memory"—the ability to recall an image with high precision after seeing it only once—this game challenges visuospatial working memory through interference tasks.

In this game, players must memorize a generated sequence of locations on a 5x5 grid. To simulate cognitive load and test retention, a distraction task (shape matching) is inserted between every memory cue.

Key Features:

🧠 Dual-Task Processing: Combines spatial memorization with rapid visual discrimination.

📈 Progressive Difficulty: Scales from Level 1 to 7, increasing sequence length while decreasing display time.

⏱️ Strict Constraints: Enforces exact ordered recall, unique dot positions, and strict countdown timers (20s–30s) to induce pressure.

🎨 Interactive UI: Features SVG-based graphics and real-time visual feedback (Gold for memorization, Green for success, Red for error).
