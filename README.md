# Getting Started with Create React App
Visuospatial Memory & Interference Game
A specialized cognitive training application built with React.js, designed to challenge visuospatial working memory through interference tasks. In this game, players must memorize a generated sequence of locations on a 5x5 grid. To simulate cognitive load and test retention, a distraction task (shape matching) is inserted between every memory cue.

Key Features:

🧠 Dual-Task Processing: Combines spatial memorization with rapid visual discrimination.

📈 Progressive Difficulty: Scales from Level 1 to 7, increasing sequence length while decreasing display time.

⏱️ Strict Constraints: Enforces exact ordered recall, unique dot positions, and strict countdown timers (20s–30s) to induce pressure.

🎨 Interactive UI: Features SVG-based graphics and real-time visual feedback (Gold for memorization, Green for success, Red for error).
